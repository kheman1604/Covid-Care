## What it does
We have made a centralized web app that enable a ton of features for hospitals have a maintained data of all its patients along with all the necessary analytics and contact information displayed in a very efficient manner . Also the we app has a chatbot to guide along the various function in the website .
## How I built it
We started off by making WebPages using HTML,CSS,JavaScript , then we connected it to the backend using nodejs framework with express connectivity and mongodb as database. Also we built the chat bot using dialogflow and nlp .We also used third party packages like nodemailer and jsPDF . 

## Challenges I ran into
One of the callenges for us was to train the chatbot and integrate it with our webapp .

## What I learned
This was our first time working with a chatbot , So it was quite challenging for us and we learnt a lot from this about new frameworks and technologies .
